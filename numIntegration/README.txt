This program estimates pi with the composite trapezoid rule, composite simpsons 1/3 rule, composite simpsons 3/8 rule, and composite boole's rule. It uses n that are a multiple of 12 that is less than 800000. The program displays the error associated with each rule for each n, and shows how fast each converges on the solution. This program runs without any inputs.

Compiled with Cygwin64 using gcc -g -std=c99 -Wall pi.c -o pi -lm
